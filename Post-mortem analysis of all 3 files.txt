Post-mortem analysis of all 3 files


Similarities
Core algorithm: All three files utilize the same core algorithm involving a running cumulative sum and a hash map (std::unordered_map) to track the frequencies of these sums.
This approach allows for an O(n) solution by leveraging the fact that finding a pervious cumulative sums that differs from the current one by k indicates a subarray sum of k.
Data Structures: They all use std::vector<int> for storing the integers and std::unnordered_map<long long, int> for mapping cumulative sums to their frequencies.
Cumulative Sum Technique: Each program calculates a running cumulative sum that iterates through the array of integers, using this sum to identify subarrays that sum to k.



Differences:

The first files operates on a statically defined small array to demonstrate the purpose.
The two other files have a function that generates large data set of random integers using the std::random_device and std::mt19937 for their tests of 10 and 50 million integers.

Handling Large Counts:

The first file is not a very large data set so no real large counts need to be addressed, and just demonstrate an easy to follow test.
The other two files have a function to return long long instead of int to handle large numbers, the 50 million integers gives a demonstation of how to use long long to avoid problems with large integers.

Performance measured:

Performance timing using std::chrono is used in the files designed for larger datasets of my 10 and 50 mil integer test, allowing for an analysis of the algorithm's efficiency on extensive data.
This feature is not present in the basic demonstration file.



Final Thoughts:

Objective: the goal wass to show and evaluate an efficent soultion to the subarray sum equals k problem.

Findings: The core algo based on cumulative sums and a hash map tracking frequencies is highly effective, offering O(n) time complexity.
For large datasets, special consideration using different data types, use long long for large counts and performance measurments is necessary.
Random data generation and timing mechanisims are important for evaluating the algorithm's performance under different conditions and scales.

Lessons:

Data Type Consideration: The importance of selecting the right data type to avoid overflow and accurately represent large values.
Performance Optimization: The necessity of efficient algos O(n) vs O(n^2) becomes more apparent as the dataset size grows and the test time increases.
Scalability: Solutions are not just good enough to be correct, but also scalable to handle real-world datasets that can be vast.



Final Thoughts:

Any large data set should use long long preemptively or another suitable data type.
More performance test measurements into the testing pahse to see scalability and efficiency.
Consider edge cases and test with both small and large datasets to make sure the robustness of the algo.

The subarray sum equals k shows how algo design and Optimization principles relevant to real-world apps. The prograssion from my simple example to 50 mil integers demonstrates the importanfce of efficent algos
and thoughtful consideration of data types ad performance in sofwaredevelopment.
